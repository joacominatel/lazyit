-- Local (first-party) authentication provisioning — ADR-0086 (F1c, issue #993).
-- Generated OFFLINE via `prisma migrate diff` (schema-to-schema, NO database connection); the
-- recent_activity view CREATE OR REPLACE is appended by hand (Prisma does not track views), mirroring
-- the 20260611180848_user_manager_clone precedent that added the MANAGER_CHANGED summary branch.

-- AlterEnum: PASSWORD_RESET_BY_ADMIN — an admin minted a LOCAL temp-password (AUTH_MODE=local, ADR-0086
-- §5), distinct from PASSWORD_RESET_SENT (an IdP reset LINK requested in OIDC mode). Lowercased, this is
-- the `password_reset_by_admin` verb the recent_activity view emits (added to RECENT_ACTIVITY_ACTIONS).
ALTER TYPE "UserHistoryEventType" ADD VALUE 'PASSWORD_RESET_BY_ADMIN';

-- AlterTable: mustChangePassword — the one-time-credential flag (ADR-0086 §5). Additive, defaulted false
-- (no backfill): existing rows are unaffected. Set true on admin provisioning / reset; ENFORCEMENT is F4.
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN     "mustChangePassword" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

-- recent_activity view (ADR-0050 / ADR-0086 §5): CREATE OR REPLACE to add the PASSWORD_RESET_BY_ADMIN
-- summary branch to the UserHistory source so a local admin reset reads as "Password reset by admin" in
-- the feed. Postgres requires the existing column list/order/names to stay byte-identical and only NEW
-- columns at the tail — none change here. The summary CASE switches on `eventType::text` (NOT the bare
-- enum) so the freshly-added value is matched as TEXT and never trips "unsafe use of new enum value"
-- (55P04) when this runs in the same transaction as the ADD VALUE above (the user_manager_clone pattern).
