-- Forgot-password ISSUANCE audit — ADR-0086 §F4 (issue #1006). A reset link being minted+sent is now
-- audited as PASSWORD_RESET_REQUESTED (actor == subject, self-service), distinct from the pre-existing
-- PASSWORD_RESET_COMPLETED (the reset actually being applied) and PASSWORD_RESET_BY_ADMIN (an admin acted).
-- Written ONLY for a real, login-capable subject (never for an unknown identifier) — the user_history log
-- is admin-only, so it is not an enumeration oracle. Generated OFFLINE (no DB connection); the
-- recent_activity view CREATE OR REPLACE is appended by hand (Prisma does not track views), mirroring the
-- 20260703020000_password_lifecycle precedent.

-- AlterEnum: PASSWORD_RESET_REQUESTED joins UserHistoryEventType. Lowercased, this is the
-- `password_reset_requested` verb the recent_activity view emits (added to RECENT_ACTIVITY_ACTIONS). The
-- view below matches it as TEXT (::text) so the freshly-added value is never used as an enum literal in the
-- same transaction (avoids 55P04 "unsafe use of new enum value").
ALTER TYPE "UserHistoryEventType" ADD VALUE 'PASSWORD_RESET_REQUESTED';

-- recent_activity view (ADR-0050 / ADR-0086 §F4): CREATE OR REPLACE to add the PASSWORD_RESET_REQUESTED
-- summary branch to the UserHistory source. Postgres requires the existing column list/order/names to stay
-- byte-identical and only NEW columns at the tail — none change here. The summary CASE switches on
-- `eventType::text` (NOT the bare enum) so the freshly-added value is matched as TEXT and never trips
-- "unsafe use of new enum value" (55P04) in the same transaction as the ADD VALUE above.
