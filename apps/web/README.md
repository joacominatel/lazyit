# @lazyit/web

Frontend for **lazyit** — the self-hosted IT management app. Next.js (App Router) +
React + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui. Talks to `@lazyit/api` over HTTP; shared contracts
live in `@lazyit/shared`. See the docs vault (`docs/`) for product and architecture
context.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Components | shadcn/ui (`radix-nova` style, `neutral` base color, CSS variables) |
| Icons | **Heroicons only** (`@heroicons/react`) — see decision below |
| Fonts | Geist + Geist Mono via `next/font/google` |
| Theming | `next-themes` (system + manual, persisted) |
| Data fetching | TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) + a thin typed `fetch` wrapper |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers`, validated by `@lazyit/shared` zod schemas |
| Toasts | `sonner` |

```

Route groups (`(marketing)`, `(auth)`, `(app)`) don't affect the URL — they only
let each section have its own layout. `/` → marketing, `/login` → auth,
`/dashboard` → app.

## Data layer (the feature pattern)

`locations/` was the first real CRUD screen and `users/` is the second — together
they are the **template** every other entity (Assets, Tickets, …) copies. Data
access is layered so each concern stays in one place:

1. **`lib/api/endpoints/<resource>.ts`** — pure async functions (`getLocations`,
   `createLocation`, …). The **only** code allowed to call `apiFetch`. Request
   and response types come from `@lazyit/shared`.
2. **`lib/api/hooks/use-<resource>.ts` + `…-mutations.ts`** — TanStack Query
   wrappers over the endpoints. Reads export their query keys (`locationKeys`);
   mutations invalidate those keys on success. Hooks never call `fetch` directly.
3. **Pages and components** consume the hooks only — they never call `apiFetch`
   or `fetch` themselves.

The repetitive parts are factored out: `lib/api/crud-endpoints.ts`
(`createCrudEndpoints`) builds the five REST bodies from per-resource generics,
and `lib/api/query-keys.ts` (`createQueryKeys`) builds the `all`/`lists`/`detail`
key factory. The TanStack hooks stay hand-written per resource on purpose —
bespoke hooks (publish, assign, by-slug) don't fit a fixed factory. See ADR-0020.

**Forms** use `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers` with the **shared zod
schema** as the single source of validation (e.g. `CreateLocationSchema`), wired
through shadcn's `Field` primitives. Empty optional inputs are mapped to
`undefined` (not `""`) so the strict shared schema treats them as untouched.

Feature-specific UI lives colocated under `app/(app)/<feature>/_components/` (the
`_` prefix opts the folder out of routing). Promote a component to `components/`
only when a second screen genuinely reuses it — don't generalize preemptively.
`UserAvatar` is the one deliberate exception: it sits in `components/` from day one
because it is obviously cross-cutting (asset assignments, tickets, access grants).
The shared list scaffolding (`<ResourceTable>` + skeleton/empty/error states,
`RowActions`) and `<DeleteConfirmDialog>` were promoted to `components/` once the
third screen made the duplication real (ADR-0020) — new screens compose them.

## Commands

Run from the repo root (preferred — uses Turborepo):

```sh
bun run dev                         # web + api together
bun run build                       # build all workspaces
```

Or scoped to this app:

```sh
bun run --filter @lazyit/web dev    # dev server on http://localhost:3000
bun run --filter @lazyit/web build
bun run --filter @lazyit/web lint
```

Add a shadcn component (writes into `components/ui/`):

```sh
bunx shadcn@latest add <component>
```

## Environment variables

One `.env` per scope with a committed `.env.example` to copy:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `http://localhost:3001` | Base URL of the lazyit API, read by `lib/api/client.ts`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined into the client bundle, so it must not hold secrets. |

## Decisions

- **Icons — Heroicons only.** App-authored UI uses `@heroicons/react` exclusively; do
  **not** introduce `lucide-react`, `react-icons` or any other set in our own code.
  `lucide-react` is installed, but only because the vendored shadcn/ui primitives use
  it internally (e.g. the dialog close, dropdown chevrons/checks). Treat it as an
  implementation detail of `components/ui/*` and never import it directly elsewhere.

- **Typography — Geist (+ Geist Mono).** Sans-serif, neutral and technical, with
  excellent legibility at small sizes — a good fit for the data-dense, "infrastructure"
  feel of an IT tool. It ships with the Next.js font pipeline (`next/font/google`,
  zero-CLS, self-hosted) and is the font the chosen shadcn `radix-nova` preset assumes.
  Geist Mono is reserved for code / identifiers / monospace data.

- **Dark mode — system + manual, persisted.** `next-themes` with
  `defaultTheme="system"` + `enableSystem`, so the first visit follows the OS; the
  `ThemeToggle` sets an explicit light/dark choice that persists in `localStorage`.
  The theme class is applied to `<html>` (hence `suppressHydrationWarning` in the root
  layout).

- **shadcn/ui — `radix-nova` style, `neutral` base color.** Radix primitives (per
  ADR-0011), with a neutral grayscale palette for a clean, minimal, non-flashy look.
  Components are copied into `components/ui/` and owned here.

## Global search

The topbar hosts a `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` command palette (`components/global-search.tsx`) that queries the
cross-cutting search endpoint (`GET /search`, Meilisearch — ADR-0035) through the `useSearch` hook.
Filtering is **server-side** — the `cmdk` Command runs with `shouldFilter={false}` and we render the
hits the API returns; cmdk still drives the keyboard navigation (↑/↓ + Enter). Results are grouped by
entity (Assets · Articles · Users · Locations · Applications) and each navigates to its detail — or
its list page where no detail exists yet (Users, Locations) and forward-compatibly to
`/applications/[id]` (the Access screen lands that route). The response is typed in `@lazyit/shared`
(`search` schema); search degrades to empty results when the API runs without `MEILI_HOST` (fail-soft).

## Status / caveats

- **No authentication yet.** Auth is deferred to an external IdP (OIDC); the API is
  open and dev-only. The `(app)` layout has no guard — see ADR-0016. The `/login` page
  and `user-menu` are visual placeholders.
- **Dev "acting user" (X-User-Id shim).** The Knowledge Base needs a caller identity for
  draft visibility and author-only writes (ADR-0022), so `apiFetch` attaches an
  `X-User-Id` header from a `localStorage`-backed acting-user store. The dev-only topbar
  `<UserSwitcher>` chooses it; "anonymous" sees only published articles. It is a stand-in
  until real auth lands, and goes away with it.
  **To use it:** pick a user from the topbar dropdown (the choice persists in
  `localStorage` and is sent on every request); if the list is empty, create a user under
  `/users` first. This is the only way to act as an author and see/edit your own drafts.
- **CORS is enabled** on the API for the web origin, so the browser calls it directly —
  the Locations and Users screens do. The example hook `lib/api/hooks/use-health.ts`
  (a bare `GET /users`) predates them and is kept only as a minimal reference; it is
  not used by any page.
