/**
 * Notification — the in-app notification bell (ADR-0056). The single source of truth for `api`
 * (emit + response typing) and `web` (render) of the curated operational nudges an admin sees in the
 * topbar bell. See docs/03-decisions/0056-in-app-notification-bell.md.
 *
 * Model in one line: each `Notification` is an **append-only event** (one immutable row per logical
 * thing-an-admin-should-glance-at), and read state is a **per-admin join** computed fan-out-on-READ.
 * This file is only the WIRE contract — the Prisma models + the per-admin `NotificationRead` join live
 * in `apps/api`. The list endpoint folds each notification's per-caller `read` flag into the item shape
 * below, so the web never stitches two lists.
 *
 * Two delivery axes (ADR-0056 amendment 2026-06-14, issue #453): a notification is either a **broadcast**
 * (`recipientUserId == null` → visible to every `notification:read` holder, the v1 admin feed) or
 * **targeted** (`recipientUserId == U` → visible to U in U's OWN bell, even when U is not an admin). The
 * read endpoints resolve, per caller: their own targeted rows (always) PLUS the broadcast set (only if
 * they hold `notification:read`). `recipientUserId` (who SEES it) is distinct from `targetUserId` (who
 * it is ABOUT).
 *
 * v1 is POLL-only (`GET /notifications` + `GET /notifications/unread-count`); SSE is a Phase-2 upgrade
 * behind the SAME endpoints and the SAME wire shapes (ADR-0056 §2) — so these types do not change when
 * realtime lands.
 *
 * Notifications are **operational nudges, not the audit system-of-record** — the append-only history
 * tables and ledgers remain that, and the bell is allowed to forget (a 90-day retention sweep on the
 * API side). Anything carried in `metadata` is REDACTED (names/ids only, never bodies/secrets — INV-6,
 * ADR-0031).

/**
 * The CLOSED catalog of notification types (catalog-as-code, the same instinct as the permission
 * catalog and the workflow enums). A typo can't mint a type; CI fails on an unknown literal; `api`
 * (emit) and `web` (render a closed set of icons/copy) agree by construction. Adding a type later is an
 * additive shared-package change. The v1 triggers (ADR-0056 §3):
 *   - `critical_app_access` — a grant opened access to an application flagged `isCritical`.
 *   - `admin_granted`       — a grant/role change raised a user to the ADMIN role.
 *   - `low_stock`           — a consumable crossed from above its `minStock` to at/below it.
 *   - `workflow.manual_task`— a workflow run paused for a human (a ManualTask was created).
 *   - `workflow.run_failed` — a workflow run failed/escalated and stopped (ADR-0054 §8).
 *   - `secret.vault_setup`  — a TARGETED login nudge (ADR-0056 amendment 2026-06-14, issue #453): a
 *     `secret:read` holder with no `UserKeypair` is prompted at login to set up their vault passphrase,
 *     deep-linking to `/secrets`. Delivered targeted (`recipientUserId = that user`) so it lands in
 *     that user's OWN bell even when they hold no `notification:read`. INV-10-safe — carries NO key
 *     material, only "you have not set up your vault" metadata + a link.

 *                    click-through; null when the nudge has no person subject (low stock, run failure).
 *   - `recipientUserId` — who SEES this notification (ADR-0056 amendment): `null` = a broadcast to
 *                    every `notification:read` holder (the v1 admin feed); a uuid = a TARGETED nudge

 *                    from `targetUserId` (who it is ABOUT): a row may carry one, both, or neither.
 *   - `metadata`   — small, REDACTED extra context (names/ids only) the web may use to enrich the row;
 *                    never bodies/secrets/PII (INV-6). Optional and free-shape jsonb on the wire.
 *   - `read`       — the per-caller read flag (folded in by the list endpoint).
 *   - `createdAt`  — when the event was recorded. The feed is newest-first by this.
