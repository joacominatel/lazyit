/**
 * RecentActivity — the unified, cross-pillar activity feed the dashboard exposes at
 * `GET /dashboard/activity` (CEO Round 2). It normalizes the FIVE append-only activity sources into
 * one chronologically-ordered stream so the dashboard can show "what happened across the IT estate"
 * without the web stitching five lists together. Single source of truth for `api` (response typing)
 * and `web` (the data layer). See docs/02-domain/entities/recent-activity.md.
 *
 * Backed by a Postgres VIEW (`recent_activity`) that `UNION ALL`s the five sources — Prisma cannot
 * express a UNION view in PSL, so the view lives as raw SQL in a migration and the API reads it with
 * a typed `$queryRaw` (ADR-0043 / ADR-0050). The view is a derived read model, NOT a persisted entity:
 * there is no schema change to any table and nothing writes to it.
 *
 * The five sources and how they map onto a row:
 *   - AssetHistory       → entityType "asset"      · action = the lowercased event (created, …)
 *   - AssetAssignment    → entityType "asset"      · action "assigned" / "released"
 *   - AccessGrant        → entityType "application" · action "granted" / "revoked"
 *   - ConsumableMovement → entityType "consumable"  · action "stock_in" / "stock_out" / "stock_adjustment"
 *   - UserHistory        → entityType "user"        · action "created" / "updated" / "role_changed" /
 *                          "deleted" / "restored" / "password_reset_sent" (DEBT-2, issue #185)
 *
 * Date fields are ISO-8601 strings (wire shape). The list is newest-first and **offset-paginated**
 * per ADR-0030 (default page size 20).

/**
 * One normalized row of the unified activity feed. `actorId` / `actorName` are the user who caused
 * the event, resolved (lightly) from `users` — both null for system/unknown actors, a service-account
 * actor, or a deleted user whose audit FK was set null. `entityId` is the affected entity's id (a cuid
 * for asset/application/consumable, a uuid for user). `summary` is a short, human-readable, server-built
 * sentence for the feed line.
 *
 * SUBJECT enrichment (issue #311): the feed line must name WHICH entity (and, where the event is about
 * a person, WHICH user) it concerns — not just "Access revoked from a user". The view resolves these
 * from the relations that already exist on each source, so the web can build a specific headline
 * ("Access to <App> revoked from <User>") and a click-through to the affected user's detail:
 *   - `subjectName`    — the AFFECTED entity's display name (the Application / Asset / Consumable name,
 *                        or the affected user's "First Last"). null when the relation resolves to no
 *                        name (e.g. a name-less row). Pairs with `entityType` + `entityId` for the
 *                        primary click-through (already the app/asset/consumable/user detail page).
 *   - `targetUserId`   — the user the event is ABOUT (the grant holder / assignment owner / the
 *                        user-history subject), as a uuid. null for events with no person subject
 *                        (asset state changes, consumable movements). Distinct from `actorId` (who did
 *                        it) — enables a SECOND click-through to that person's detail page.
 *   - `targetUserName` — that user's display name ("First Last"), or null when there is no target user.
 *
 * Every subject field is NULLABLE: a source that carries no subject (or a soft-deleted/unresolved
 * relation) yields null, and the web falls back to the generic `summary`. This keeps the row contract
 * backward-compatible — older `summary`-only rendering still works.
